How to run PyMQI's test suite
=============================

* The test suite itself requires at least Python 2.5 because of its reliance
  on the 'uuid' module which has been introduced in 2.5

* Install nose and testfixtures
  $ sudo pip install nose
  $ sudo pip install testfixtures

* Set a proper configuration by modifying the defaults in config.py or override
  these properties with environment variables, see config.py, if necessary.
* Prepare the test environment using create_mq_objects.py (needs a local MQ
  server installation to access the MQ command executables) or create the 
  objects by hand, consistent with the configuration. 
* Use nose to execute the tests:
 * Directly:
   $ nosetests
   Note that you need an inplace build of pymqe.so if you want to run the tests
   on the checkout rather than e.g. a test installation
   (python setup.py build_ext --inplace). 
 * Through setup.py:
   $ python setup.py nosetests 
   (this issues an inplace-build automatically)
 * [Delete the test environment with delete_mq_objects.py]
* (That's all)
