PyMQI - Python interface to WebSphere MQ (MQSeries)
-------------------------------------------------------

**Sponsored by [Zato](https://zato.io/docs?pymqi-docs) - ESB, SOA, REST, APIs and Cloud Integrations in Python**

PyMQI allows one to connect to queue managers to issue MQAI and PCF requests.

Consider the code below which establishes a connection, puts a message
on a queue and disconnects.

```python
    import pymqi
    
    queue_manager = 'QM01'
    channel = 'SVRCONN.1'
    host = '192.168.1.135'
    port = '1434'
    queue_name = 'TEST.1'
    message = 'Hello from Python!'
    conn_info = '%s(%s)' % (host, port)
    
    qmgr = pymqi.connect(queue_manager, channel, conn_info)
    
    queue = pymqi.Queue(qmgr, queue_name)
    queue.put(message)
    queue.close()
    
    qmgr.disconnect()
```
